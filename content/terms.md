## WHAT IS A IndamFake ACCOUNT?

A IndamFake Account is an electronic money account, from which you can make and receive payments. You can use your account to make transfers to other accounts, set up standing orders, and make direct debit payments. You can only spend money that you have paid into your account, so before making transfers you need to make sure there are enough funds in the account. Monies in the IndamFake account are not bank deposits and do not earn interest.

## WHO CAN APPLY FOR A IndamFake ACCOUNT?

You must be at least 18 years old and a BanalaLand resident to be issued with a IndamFake account. You must provide a copy of your passport or driving license, proof of your residential address, email address, and a mobile phone number to open an account, so that we can communicate with you. There is a maximum limit of 10 accounts allowed to be opened at each residential address.

## HOW CAN I APPLY FOR THE IndamFake ACCOUNT?

You can apply on our website https://localhost:3000, or via IndamFake App that you can download from Google Play or Apple Store. Before we open an account for you, we may require evidence of your identity and residential address. We may also need to carry out checks on your identity electronically.

## HOW DO I ADD FUNDS TO THE IndamFake ACCOUNT?

You may add funds to your account via bank transfer from another bank.

The time taken to credit funds to your account will depend on the method of deposit used. You cannot pay into your account by a balance transfer from a credit card. You may only pay in funds up to your maximum account balance. Certain minimum and maximum limits and usage requirements apply to your account; such limits and requirements are detailed in the Fees and Limits table (section 33). We reserve the right to refuse to accept any particular payment, if we suspect any fraudulent activity, or in the event of other exceptional circumstances.

As soon as we receive the funds that you have paid in, they will be on your account and ready to use. There may be occasions, when we delay the funds reaching your account for up to three working days. This may happen when we need to confirm the transaction with the sending bank. Where an overpayment has been made to your account in error, we reserve the right to debit the account with the excess amount, to correct the payment transaction. You may transfer funds to your envelopes within your account, details are available at the website https://localhost:3000. . You are also responsible for ensuring there are enough funds in your envelope to pay any future standing orders or direct debits you have set up.

## DOES THE IndamFake ACCOUNT HAVE SPENDING LIMITS?

You can only spend the money that is paid into your account. See the Fees and Limits table (section 33) and your online account portal for further details. If for any reason, the transaction is completed, when there are insufficient funds in your account then you will have to reimburse the shortfall to us, unless it is due to an error by the retailer, with whom you made the transaction. We may collect this shortfall from any funds which you subsequently pay into your account.

## WHAT IF I HAVE BEEN OVERCHARGED OR CHARGED FOR TRANSACTIONS I DIDN’T MAKE?

If you dispute an account transaction, you should contact us without undue delay and in any event within 13 months on becoming aware of any unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transaction. Where you have informed us that an executed payment was not authorised by you in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, and you have taken all reasonable steps to keep personalised security information safe from anyone, who may have acted fraudulently, we will:

A. refund the amount of the unauthorised payment to you; and

B. restore the debited payment account to the state it would have been in had the unauthorised payment not taken place.

Beyond this, we will have no further liability to you. Where payee details provided by you are incorrect, we are not liable for non-execution or defective execution of the payment transaction, but we will make reasonable efforts to recover the funds involved in the payment transaction and notify you of the outcome.

You may be entitled to claim a refund in relation to transactions where:

A. the transaction was not authorised under these Terms and Conditions;

B. we are responsible for a transaction that we fail to execute or incorrectly execute.

In these circumstances, we will refund to you the amount of the non-executed or defective payment transaction and restore the debited payment account to the state in which it would have been had the defective payment transaction not taken place.

We will also refund to you: (a) any direct charges for which you are responsible; and (b) any interest which you must pay, as a consequence of the non-execution or defective execution of the payment transaction; or a pre-authorised transaction did not specify the exact amount at the time of its authorisation and the amount charged is more than could reasonably be expected, taking into account the circumstances of the transaction.

We will either refund the full amount of the payment transaction; or provide justification for refusing to refund the payment transaction. Any refund or justification for refusing a refund will be provided within 10 business days of receiving a request for a refund or, where applicable, within 10 business days of receiving any further information requested.

## WHAT ABOUT SECURITY

You must keep your security credentials safe and not let anyone else know or use them. You must keep your security information secret at all times; never disclose your security information to anyone. Security information includes your login and password details used to access your account or any other website where your account details are stored. We also recommend that you check the balance on your account regularly on the mobile app, through logging onto your account at the website https://localhost:3000 or by contacting Customer Services.

## WHAT IF MY IndamFake ACCOUNT DETAILS ARE COMPROMISED?

If you you suspect that someone else has found out your security information or accessed your account without your permission, you must tell us without undue delay by calling us or logging onto your account through the mobile app or website and notifying us. If you ask us to do so, and provided that you provide the information and assistance that we request from you, we will investigate any disputed transaction or misuse of your account. If the investigations show that any disputed transaction was authorised by you, or you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence (for example by failing to keep your security information or by failing to notify us without delay on becoming aware of the loss, theft, misappropriation or unauthorised use of the account), then we will not refund the transaction amount and you will be fully liable for all losses incurred because of the unauthorised use of the account.

If the investigations show that you have not acted fraudulently or with gross negligence, your maximum loss or liability to us for any unauthorised transaction will be limited to 35 and we will process a refund as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than the end of the business day following the day after we receive your notification.

## WILL YOU EVER BLOCK A TRANSACTION WITHOUT ME ASKING?

We may refuse to pay a transaction:

A. if we are concerned about the security of your account or we suspect your account is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;

B. if sufficient funds are not paid into your account at the time of a transaction to cover the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees;

C. if there is a negative balance on your account;

D. if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are not using the account in accordance with these Terms & Conditions;

E. if we believe that a transaction is potentially suspicious or illegal (for example, if we believe that a transaction is being made fraudulently); or

F. because of errors, failures (whether mechanical or otherwise), or refusal to process a transaction by merchants, payment processors, or payment schemes such as Visa, BACS, or CHAPS.

If we refuse a transaction, we will tell you why immediately, if we can, unless it would be unlawful for us to do so. You may correct any information we hold and which may have caused us to refuse a transaction by contacting Customer Services.

## CAN I CANCEL MY IndamFake ACCOUNT?

You have a legal right to cancel your account up to 14 days from the date your account is opened without incurring any penalty. All fees and charges will be apportioned up until the time of the termination of the contract, and any fees and charges paid in advance will be reimbursed proportionally. You will not be entitled to a refund of money you have already spent on transactions authorised, or pending, or any fees for use of the account before the account is cancelled or expires.

## COULD MY IndamFake ACCOUNT BE CANCELLED?

We may cancel your account and this agreement by giving you at least two months’ notice. Reasons for cancellation may include:

A. if this agreement expires;

B. If your agreement with the Distributor for the IndamFake wallet services is cancelled or terminated for any reason;

C. if you do not add funds to a IndamFake account that has had a negative balance for 2 months. You cannot open a new account until you pay the owed fee;

D. if you break an important part of this agreement, or repeatedly break the agreement and fail to resolve the matter in a timely manner;

E. if you act in a manner that is threatening or abusive to our staff, or any of our representatives; or

F. if you fail to pay fees or charges that you have incurred.

We may also cancel your account immediately if we:

G. have any other security concerns; or

H. need to do so to comply with the law.

We may also deny access to your account where we consider it to be at risk of money laundering or terrorism financing, fraud, or other criminal activity. Should we need to take these actions and where possible, we will give reasons for doing so except where restricted by law. In these circumstances, you must tell us what you want us to do with any unused funds. You must do this within 3 months of the date we tell you that your account is cancelled.

## CAN I GET MONEY BACK ONCE I HAVE PUT IT ON?

You can clear the balance on your account through spending or transfers to other bank accounts. See the Fees & Limits table (section 33) for the fees that would apply. Alternatively, you may request a refund of the funds on your account by contacting Customer Services. We will transfer your funds back to you at no cost to you, unless:

A. you are requesting redemption before termination or expiry of this agreement;

B. you cancel this agreement before any agreed termination or expiry date; or

C. you request redemption more than one year after the date of termination or expiry of this agreement.

If one of these situations does apply, then we will charge a Redemption Fee (see the Fees and Limits table (section 33)). We will not redeem the value of the funds on your account to you if your request for redemption of the funds is more than six years after the date of termination or expiry of this agreement. All funds will be returned to a bank account of your choice. We reserve the right to see proof of your ownership of the bank account before transferring funds to it. To enable us to comply with our legal obligations, we may ask you to provide us with certain information such as identification documents before we can process your refund request. Please also refer to section 28 below for the circumstances in which we do not give you a refund.

## IS MONEY ON MY IndamFake ACCOUNT PROTECTED LIKE MY BANK ACCOUNT?

The account is an electronic money product and although it is a product regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, it is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. No other compensation scheme exists to cover losses claimed in connection with the account. We will however ensure that any funds received by you are held in a segregated account so that should we become insolvent your funds will be protected against claims made by our creditors.

## WHAT IF I HAVE A COMPLAINT?

If you are unhappy in any way with your account or the way it is managed, you can contact Customer Services so we can investigate the circumstances for you. Any complaints you have will be dealt with quickly and fairly. We will make every possible effort to address all points of the complaint by email. We will respond within 15 business days upon receiving the complaint. If a full response cannot be providing within these timeframes, we will send a holding reply with a full response to follow within 35 business days.

## WHAT IF I CHANGE MY DETAILS?

You must let us know as soon as possible if you change your name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address. If we contact you in relation to your account we will use the most recent contact details you have provided to us. Any e-mail or SMS text message sent to you will be treated as being received as soon as it is sent by us. We will not be liable to you if your contact details have changed and you have not told us.

## WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We are the controller of your personal data which we will use in order to open, administer and run your account. You hereby consent to us accessing, processing, and retaining any information you provide to us, for the purposes of providing payment services to you.

## WILL THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS EVER CHANGE?

We may change these Terms & Conditions by notifying you by e-mail or other agreed means at least two months before the change is due to happen. We will assume that you agree with the change.

An up-to-date version of the account Terms & Conditions, as well as any notices of future changes, will always be available via our website https://localhost:3000. You should check our website and your online account portal regularly for such notices and changes.

## WHEN MAY USE OF THE IndamFake ACCOUNT BE INTERRUPTED?

From time to time, your ability to use your account may be interrupted, e.g. when we carry out systems maintenance. If this happens, you may be unable (a) to use your account to pay for purchases and/or (b) to obtain information about the funds available in your account and/or about your recent transactions. This may be because of a systems problem, something outside our reasonable control, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or because we have suspended, restricted, or cancelled your account or refused to replace it in accordance with these Terms & Conditions.

## WHAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY?

If we incorrectly deduct funds from your account, we will refund them. If we subsequently establish that the refunded amount had in fact been correctly deducted, we may deduct it from your available balance and may charge you a fee. If you do not have sufficient available balance, you must repay us the amount immediately on demand. If unauthorised transactions occur after you have notified us of the loss, theft, compromise, or unauthorised use of your account, and you have not acted fraudulently or in breach of these Terms and Conditions, then we will be liable. We will not be liable:

A. for any interruption, disruption, or impairment of our service or any third party services on which we rely for the performance of our obligations hereunder;

B. for refusing to authorise a transaction;

C. for cancelling or suspending the use of your account;

D. for any loss arising from your inability to access your account due to interruptions;

E. for any direct or indirect loss or damage you may suffer including loss of revenue, loss of reputation, goodwill, opportunity, or anticipated savings as a result of your total or partial use or inability to use mobile app, website, or account or the use of your account by any third party (unless otherwise required by law);

A. use your account fraudulently;

B. do not use your account in accordance with these Terms & Conditions; or
